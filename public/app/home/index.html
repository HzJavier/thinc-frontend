<h1>Welcome to rate the crew</h1><br>
	Everyday we get in touch with people in any organization or company, and there is a valuable thing that really matters: <br><br><b>"customer service"</b><br><br>
	Many times we get serviced very well, but it is not always a plasurable memory, so,<br><br>
	<b><i>"Because everyone deserves to be recognized!... or booed!"</i></b><br><br>
	that is why i have developed this tool, you can rate people, specifically, and not a company as you usually do, globally.
